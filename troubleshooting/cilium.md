To delete all the BPF maps related to the Cilium Helm chart, you can use the bpftool command to identify and remove them. Here are the steps to do this:

List BPF Maps: First, list all the BPF maps to identify the ones related to Cilium:

sudo bpftool map show
Delete Cilium BPF Maps: Use the bpftool command to delete each map related to Cilium. You can use a loop to automate this process:

for map_id in $(sudo bpftool map show | grep cilium | awk '{print $1}'); do
    sudo bpftool map delete id $map_id
done
This script will find all maps with names containing "cilium" and delete them.

Verify Deletion: After deletion, list the BPF maps again to ensure they have been removed:
sudo bpftool map show
These steps will help you clear all the BPF maps related to the Cilium Helm chart.
