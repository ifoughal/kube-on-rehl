    # Create a Secret API object to store a non-expiring token for the service account.
    # Prior to v1.24.0, Kubernetes used to generate this secret for each service account by default.
    # Kubernetes now recommends using short-lived tokens from the TokenRequest API or projected volumes instead if possible.
    # For more details, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#service-account-token-secrets
    # serviceAccount.create must be equal to 'true' in order to use this feature.
